I should really start taking pictures if I'm going to post recipes. But imagine
if you will a plate of pear slices, fried until they are golden brown on both
sides, the outside crispy, the inside smooth and sweet, and all of it covered in
streusel that tastes amazing. Got it? Good. Here goes.  **Serves 1.**

##### Ingredients

* 1 pear
* 2 tbl butter
* Small handful of fresh sage leaves
* 1/4 cp crushed pecans
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* Salt
* 1tbl Brown sugar

I slice my pear flat, with slices about 1/4 inch thick (half a cm). Heat a cast
iron skillet on medium until it's thoroughly warm. Add the butter and salt and
brown it. It will start to smell "nutty" and the foam will have mostly settled
when it's ready. When the butter is brown, add the sage leaves and let them fry
for a second or three. Then add the pears and arrange in the pan so that they
are flat. Let them fry until the surface is golden, about 8 minutes on a side.

Remove the pears with a slotted spoon when they're done enough for you, and put
on a plate.  Then quickly toss the pecans in the pan, sprinkle with brown sugar,
cinnamon, and nutmeg, and stir around to toast gently till the mixture binds a
bit and soaks up the butter.  

Spread this mixture over the pears and serve.

This is *not* in any way, shape, or form a balanced breakfast; but it sure does
go amazingly well with coffee or Earl Grey tea.

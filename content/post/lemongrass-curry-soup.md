I was going for something Thai-ish without following any particular recipe.
What I came out with was pretty incredible.   Use a fairly light vegetable broth
for this recipe: either a miso broth or I use the Swanson's organic vegetable
broth.  The taste of this one is at once hearty and very very full of Spring.
The whole thing took about 35 minutes from start to finish.

- 1 tbl massaman curry paste or 1/2tbl red curry paste
- 2 tbl olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 onion, sliced and halved (to make "noodles"
- 1/4 lb fresh baby spinach, trimmed and washed
- 1/2 cucumber, diced
- 1/4 cp cashew halves
- 4 cp vegetable broth
- 1 can coconut milk, full fat (Thai Kitchen is my favorite)
- 1 tsp shredded kaffir lime leaves
- 1 1/2 tbl lemongrass paste (comes in a tube at the grocery store)
- 1/4 cp chopped mushrooms
- 1/3 cp cubed chicken or Quorn tenders
- 3-4 tbl lime juice

Heat the oil on medium in a heavy stockpot.  Add the curry paste and fry until
fragrant and the oil changes color.  Add the onions and garlic and cashews and
chicken and satuee until the onions have begun to wilt and everything is coated
nicely. Add broth, mushrooms, lemongrass paste, kaffir lime leaf, lime juice,
and simmer for 12 minutes.  Add the spinach and rice noodles, and bring to a
boil for 6 minutes.  Remove from heat, sitr in the coconut milk, add cucumber,
and serve.

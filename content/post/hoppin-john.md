When I was growing up, we held with the southern tradition of eating blackeyed peas on New Years Day.  Mind you, we did not hold truck with hog jowls - I've had those, but that was not my family's thing, and anyway what a way to stink up the house.  But of course, we hated the peas.  I don't know rightly where Mom got this recipe, and I've modified it slightly over the years in any case.  It's simple.  It's spicy.  And the blackeyed peas lend it just the right flavor.  

Ingredients:
- 3 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 red onion, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1 12oz package pork sausage (or veg sausage in my case that will hold up to stew)
- 2 cans blackeyed peas, drained
- 1 can rotel (tomatoes and green chiles)
- 1-2 cans water
- 1 bay leaf

Break the sausage up into thumb-sized chunks and brown it over medium heat in a stockpot.  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.  Fry the celery, onion, bell pepper, and spices in the drippings plus a little oil or bacon grease if needed until the onions are clear.  Toss the bay leaf, sausage, blackeyed peas, and rotel in along with a can of water, cover, and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer, still covered, and check in 10 minutes or so if more water is needed.  Add it and cook for a further 20 minutes or so.  

Serve with cornbread.  Or if you're me, miniature masa pancakes.

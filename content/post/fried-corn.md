Yes, fried corn.  My mom reminded me of this great Arkansas delicacy last night as she and my dad sat downstairs in the basement waiting for the sirens to stop going off and for the tornadoes to pass over.  They did.  Everyone's safe and happy, but we're still left with the elephant in the room that is fried corn.

What is fried corn?  Take three ears of corn, cut the kernels off the cob, and then put 2.5 tbl of butter in a skillet and turn up to medium - medium hi on the stove.  Once that's melted and starting to brown a bit, toss the corn in and add salt (if you've used unsalted butter).  Stifry for a minute or to and then let fry still and toss occasionally.  Continue to fry until the corn starts to turn brown or red on the edges, which means that it's caramelizing and tasty.

Add to this the rest of the lunch I made:
- Sauteed collard greens done with a bit of lime, onion, and garlic
- Steamed blackeye peas tossed with e.v. olive oil and salt
- Buttermilk mashed potatoes (with the skins left on)

and you have something close to what my great grandmother used to make. Yay.

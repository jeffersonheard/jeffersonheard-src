# Consulting

As a consultant, my specialties are designing systems for situational awareness,
mapping and geography, software architecture, mobile support, and
building multi-disciplinary software teams. I will work with your leadership to
take a product from idea to production, developing the tools and team to manage
its lifecycle and drive continued innovation and user-satisfaction.

# Expert Software Development Services

I am and always will be *passionate* about coding. I learned to read between
Dr. Seuss and the TI-99/4A BASIC example programs (my dad was also a tech nut
back in the day). Writing code is a part of me, and something that I will do no
matter how long I organize teams, start startups, and manage lifecycles.

I have written, maintained, and architected software in most of the
major programming languages and several of the obscure ones. I am most at home
in full-stack web application environments, mobile software, web APIs, and in
constructing data science applications.

I take pride in code quality, and developing maintainable software that can be
handed off to a team, or developed within that team.

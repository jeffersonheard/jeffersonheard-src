# About Me

I am the Chief Technical Officer of [365 Pronto](https://www.365pronto.com), a
renewable energy company that focuses on directing service work to local,
trained, and established professionals. We provide rapidly available service to
electric power assets: solar PV installations, electric vehicle chargers, etc.

## Career

In my career, I have started and joined in three software and solar startups,
including [365 Pronto](https://www.365pronto.com). I form the technical
backbone, and design and architect product offerings for rapid development, and
for later customer-focused scalability. I know when and how to optimize a
product. I know how to build a team that can maintain and innovate for the
product's lifetime.

At UNC's [Renaissance Computing Institute (Renci)](http://www.renci.org) I spent
a significant amount of time in applied research,  focusing on my love of maps,
especially data intensive maps, and mapping  platforms that respond to a
developing situation in real-time with analytics  and information. I was the
lead architect for the [Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org) project, for
sharing large datasets and computationally intensive analytics among the
hydrology community. I also created data science and information visualization
projects throughout my time there.  

## Design Philosophy: Humane Software

My passion in computing lies in fostering something I like to call **Humane
Software**. Humane Software is a goal, not a discipline in and of itself. It
takes elements from human-computer interfaces, mobile computing, internet of
things technologies, information design and visualization, and design
philosophies (think The Design of Everyday Things) and focuses them around
creating software that adapts to a user's expertise, rather than forcing the
user to adapt their expertise to the software.

Think of it as a kind of automation, but the kind of automation that expects a
human to be part of the process, and tries to interfere as little as possible
with the way that person works.

Humane Software is most applicable towards enhancing the performance of skilled
work. It is the business of automating processes that distract a worker from
their task. It is the business of providing a "second pair of eyes" when one is
needed to ensure fine, complex tasks are executed flawlessly every time.

In addition to my quest for Humane Software, I like to stay adept at programming
and at networked system design - web services, security, reliable computing. I
am fluent in many programming languages and paradigms. My tools are the
fundamentals of computer science, engineering, and teamwork; not one programming
language or another. You'll find many of my examples to be in Python or
Javascript, because these languages are in common use and readily understandable
to many people. But I also code in Common Lisp, Prolog, Ruby, C/C++, Java, and a
dozen other languages, depending on the task.
